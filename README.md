# Welcome to the XR Study Group by Women Who Code Tokyo!

We aim to form a community where we can support each other learning, practicing, and sharing ideas about XR technologies!.

In this repository we will share resources to quick off your study in XR, as well as presentations, tutorials, and others materials from past and current events.

You can find our ongoing session in [Women Who Code Tokyo Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Tokyo).
