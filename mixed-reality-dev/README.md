# Mixed Reality projects

In this repo, you will share resources and MR projects that we are working on during the study sessions. 

Mixed Reality is perhaps one of the XR technologies that will have a greater impact in the comming future, but the technology is not easily accessible yet. However, we will be exploring alternatives while the technology evolves and becomes more accesible.

## Here are some free resources to get started:

* [Oculus Mixed Reality with Passthrough](https://developer.oculus.com/blog/mixed-reality-with-passthrough/)

* [Oculus Passthrough API Overview](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/unity-passthrough/)

* [Microsoft - Introduction to mixed reality](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-mixed-reality/)

* [Microsoft Mixed Reality documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/)

## Inspirational content:

* [So you want to switch to a career in Mixed Reality!](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/events/ignite-mar-2021/azure/learning-zone/lrn237/) 

We are in an early stage of the WWCode Tokyo XR and we will be adding more resources as we move into Mixed Reality during the study sessions.

Stay tunned !
