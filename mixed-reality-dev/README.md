# Mixed Reality projects

In this repo, you will find MR projects that we are working on during the study sessions. 

Mixed Reality is perhaps one of the XR technologies that will have a greater impact in the comming future, but the technology is not easily accessible yet. However, we will be exploring "budget friendly" alternatives while the technology evolves and becomes more accesible.

We are in an early stage of the WWC XR, so you can expect that we will be adding resources moving forward, so stay tunned !
