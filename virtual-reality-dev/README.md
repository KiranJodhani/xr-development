# Virtual Reality projects

In this repo, you will find VR projects that we are working on during the study sessions. 

We are in an early stage of the WWC XR, so you can expect that we will be adding resources moving forward, so Stay tunned !


## Frameworks

For people that come from Front-end background, the following framework is a great way to start getting familiar with VR development.

* [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/)
A web framework for building virtual reality (VR) experiences. A-Frame is based on top of HTML, making it simple to get started. The core is a powerful entity-component framework that provides a declarative, extensible, and composable structure to [three.js](https://threejs.org/).
